# Delinea Secret Server - Terraform Provider

The [Delinea](https://delinea.com/) [Secret Server](https://delinea.com/products/secret-server/) [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) Provider allows you to access and reference Secrets in your vault for use in Terraform configurations.

For Delinea's official Terraform documentation, please see [here](https://docs.delinea.com/online-help/integrations/terraform/index.htm) for more information.

## Example Usage

For Terraform 0.13+, include the `terraform` block in your configuration or plan to that specifies the provider:

terraform {
  required_providers {
    tss = {
      source = "DelineaXPM/tss"
      version = "~> 2.0"

    }
  }
}
```

To run the example, create a `terraform.tfvars`:

```json
tss_username   = "my_app_user"
tss_password   = "Passw0rd."
tss_server_url = "https://localhost/SecretServer"
tss_secret_id  = "1"
